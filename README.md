**Odin Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors** 

This is a simple implementation of the classic game "rock, paper, scissors" written in JavaScript.

**Description**

The user receives a prompt to make their choice to play against the computer. The computer makes a random choice each round. The game lasts for a total of five rounds, and the winner is determined based on who wins the most rounds. Invalid inputs are caught and not counted as rounds. This current iteration is focused only on the logic and functionality. A future revision will implement a GUI for a better user experience.

**What I Learned**

- How to use vanilla JavaScript logic to implement a game
- How to generate random numbers using Math.random()
- How to use conditionals and loops to control program flow and repeat actions
- How to handle user inputs using prompt() and how to validate input using conditionals
- How to use console.log() to output messages to the console for debugging and game status feedback

**Thoughts and observations**

Overall, this project helped me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and apply them to a fun and engaging project. I look forward to returning to the project to implement a GUI to allow for a more engaging user experience.
